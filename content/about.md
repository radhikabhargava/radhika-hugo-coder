Hi there! Good to see you here.

This is my academic website to give a quick overview of the little modest work I have done or am doing in the field of Psychology. I am a UGC-JRF PhD fellow at the Department of Applied Psychology, University of Mumbai since 2024. I have taught as a ad-hoc faculty at University of Mumbai's Department of Applied Psychology from 2019 to 2024. 

After completing my graduation from Jai Hind College, Mumbai in 2016, I went on to complete a Masters in Psychology from Mumbai University in 2018. My first job was at L.S. Raheja College's Department of Psychology from 2018 to 2019. Since 2019, I have been associated with University of Mumbai as a faculty member where I am also registered for their doctoral program since 2021. 

I work in the areas of personality and trait psychology, political psychology and leadership in the political space. Understanding how individual differences like personality, moral values, ideological systems are structured in India's indigenous languages is of special interest to me. 

Simultaneously,  I am developing open source material that can be used to run text mining algorithms in Indian languages (particularly, Hindi). 

I wish to make my small contribution in understanding India better through the lens of a psychologist. If you share a similar vision or have questions about my work, you'll find my email ID below. Thanks for reading through!
